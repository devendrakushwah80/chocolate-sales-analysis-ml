# 🍫 Chocolate Sales Analysis & Prediction

## Repository Name (Suggested)

**chocolate-sales-analysis-ml**

## Notebook Name (Suggested)

**chocolate_sales_eda_and_classification.ipynb**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning–based classification** on a chocolate sales dataset. The goal is to understand sales patterns across countries, products, and salespersons, and to **predict whether a sale amount is High or Low** based on multiple features.

The notebook demonstrates a **complete data science workflow** including data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using multiple ML algorithms.

## 📂 Dataset Description

**File:** `Chocolate Sales.csv`

### Columns:

* **Sales Person** – Name of the salesperson
* **Country** – Country of sale
* **Product** – Chocolate product type
* **Date** – Date of transaction
* **Amount** – Sales amount (currency formatted)
* **Boxes Shipped** – Number of boxes shipped

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed in the Notebook

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Inspection

* Loaded dataset using Pandas
* Viewed head, tail, shape, columns, and data types
* Used `info()` and `describe()` for structural and statistical overview

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Converted **Amount** column from currency string to numeric
* Converted **Date** column to `datetime` format
* Extracted:

  * **Month**
  * **Year**

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Total sales by **Country**
* Total boxes shipped by **Product**
* Total sales by **Sales Person**
* Monthly sales trends
* Scatter plot: **Boxes Shipped vs Amount**

### 4️⃣ Feature Engineering

* Created a **binary target variable**:

  * High Sale (1): Amount ≥ Median
  * Low Sale (0): Amount < Median
* Selected features:

  * Country (categorical)
  * Product (categorical)
  * Boxes Shipped (numerical)
  * Month (derived from Date)

### 5️⃣ Train–Test Split

* Split data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

All models are implemented using **Scikit-learn Pipelines** with preprocessing:

* **Logistic Regression**
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
* **Decision Tree Classifier**
* **Random Forest Classifier**

### Preprocessing Techniques:

* One-Hot Encoding for categorical features
* Standard Scaling for numerical features

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation

Each model is evaluated using:

* **Accuracy Score**
* **Classification Report**

A comparison table is generated to easily identify the best-performing model.

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* Sales performance varies significantly by **country and product**
* Feature engineering (Month, median-based classification) improves modeling
* Ensemble models (Random Forest) generally outperform simpler models
* Pipelines ensure clean, reusable, and scalable ML workflows
